# FASHION-MNIST

Implementation of Fashion MNIST project using different machine learning models such as KNN, SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost . This project was mainly built to identify the difference in several standardisation techniques and also for observing the performance of the models after grid search hyper parameter tuning. 

This project indicates the importance of hyper parameter tuning in machine learning models for the best performance of the models on unseen data.
