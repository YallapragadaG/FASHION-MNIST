# FASHION-MNIST

Implementation of Fashion MNIST project using Different machine learning models. This project was mainly built to identify the difference in several standardisation technqies and also for observing the performance of the models after grid serach hyper parameter tuning. 

This project indicates the importance of hyper paramerter tuning in machine learning models for the best performance of the models on unseen data.
